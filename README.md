### OOJS Connect Four Game
This project uses Object-Oriented JavaScript to create an online version of a Connect Four game.


## Project objective
To complete this project I created JavaScript classes (Game, Board, Space, Player, Token) to organize the code. Each class, with its constructor function, methods, getters and setters is in its own .js file, and the app.js file handles the interaction with DOM elements.

## Techniques and concepts
- JavaScript classes used to create objects and organize code.
